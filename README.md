gps2exif - GPS-tagging of JPEG files
====================================
gps2exif reads .gpx files and tags JPEG images according to the
time they have been taken. It allows to fix image date/time and
interpolates between GPS points.

General syntax
--------------
```
 gps2exif [-h] [-n] [-v] [--gpx GPX]
 [--ref-img REF_IMAGE] [--ref-time REF_TIME]
 [--shift-time SHIFT_TIME] [--max-dist MTRS] [--max-span SECS]
 [--ok-dist MTRS] [--ok-span SECS] IMAGE [IMAGE ...]
```

You can give multiple .gpx files using the `--gpx FILE` switch
multiple times. Give the names of the image files to be processed
at the end of the command line. The switch `-n` will make a
dry-run and not change any file. The `-v` switch increases
verbosity.

Fixing image date/time
----------------------
A precise date/time stored in the image's EXIF data is crucial for
associating the GPS track with the image. gps2exif offers two
ways to fix the date/time stored in the JPEG files before looking
up the GPS coordinates:

- You can either give the name of a file and the correct date/time
  of the file. gps2exif will calculate the time offset and apply
  it to all given images. This is ideal if you took a photo of
  your GPS device showing GPS time.

  The syntax is `--ref-img REF_IMAGE --ref-time REF_TIME`.
  `REF_TIME` should be formatted like `2011-10-22 14:42:07`.
- If you know the time offset, you can give it via
  `--shift-time SHIFT_TIME`.
  For example, use `--shift-time=+1:09` to add 1 minute, 9 seconds
  to the time of each image.

Setting thresholds
------------------
Under some circumstances GPS devices do not store enough points to
make a precise-enough guess about the location a photo was taken
at. You can set the thresholds that control whether the GPS data
is deemed good enough or not.

The thresholds are checked on the two GPS points around the time
your photo was taken: the last GPS point before and the first GPS
point after the time of your photo. You can set thresholds on the
time span and the distance between these two GPS points.

With `--max-dist MTRS` and `--max-span SECS` you set hard
thresholds. A photo will not be GPS-tagged if the two enclosing
GPS points are more than `MTRS` meters or more than `SECS` seconds
apart.

With `--ok-dist MTRS` and `--ok-span SECS` you set the okay
criteria. A photo will not be GPS-tagged if the two GPS enclosing
points are neither closer than `MTRS` meters nor closer than
`SECS` seconds.

A photo will only be GPS-tagged if both max criteria and at least
one ok criterion is met.
